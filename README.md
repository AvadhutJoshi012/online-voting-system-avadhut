The  system aims to replace the traditional paper-based voting process with a secure, transparent, and  efficient web-based platform that allows registered users to cast their votes electronically. 


I am managing Candidate Services & Create Election Window.
The Online Voting System is a secure, web-based application designed to manage elections digitally.
This repository focuses on two core modules:

Election Creation Module

Candidate Management Module

These modules are primarily used by the Admin to configure elections and manage candidate data officially received from the Election Commission.
